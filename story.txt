# Story starts here!

There once was a Bratwurst salesman in Berlin, who took his horse in the Hauptstrasse. 
He rode his horse down the Hauptstrasse all the way to th Biergarten. 
Looking to his right, he saw two very wettbewerbsfaehig men drinking what looked like their 12th drink each.
The Bratwurst salesman thought to himself,
    "These men must be from Berlin, they are sehr wettbewerbsfaehig drinkers. But I am the better drinker".
And so the Bratwurst salesamn drank himself silly, and ended up crashing into a waitress holding several Gebaecks.
Poor waitress. After all of the Brot and Apfelkuchen she made from her Baeckrei, this man just crashes on her and wastes all of her efforts.
She was so mad that her dirndl was ruined, she pushed him into the baeckerei and put a schloss on the door.
As the salesman flew into the room from her mighty push, he crashed into a shelf getting covered in flour, the waitress exclaimed,
    "There, your Lederhose are ruined!"
The salesman clapped back,
    "It's no problem, I have sold many a klimaanlages from BMW, one soiled Lederhose is nothing to cry over"
    "I will use the brot in in this Baeckerei to make the finest Dirndel from Eltz!"
With his Hund's locket, he picked the schloss on the baeckerei's door made from the finest wood in Berlin.
With his new Dirndel, on his horse from Porsche he rode, he opened a new Bratwurst store in Rammstein.
The store was extremely successful, and was a well known store in Berlin's Hauptstrasse.
At his new store, the salseman began expanding into gabaeck with apfelkuchen and assorrted brot. 
Und, with his wettbewerbsfaehig at worst venture from his quality bratwurst, his product went as viral as Rammstein.
People from all over the world flew into the nearest flughafen in hopes to try his bratwurst.
The Bratwurst Salesman then bought his Hund his own Lederhose and Porsche.
He wouldn't have it so easy though, as there was a Doener shop right next door!
